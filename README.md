## Description
Using mySQL and NodeJs, I created an employee tracker that enables the user to see a database of the employees at a company. 

## Installation
Clone this repo, and ensure you have Nodejs installed. Install all dependencies, and source the schema and seed file using mySQL. Run the code using node index.js in your terminal.

## Usage
Once the user has run the file in their terminal, they will be prompted to choose froma list of options. User will need to input their selection. They have the option to view employees, departments, and roles. They can also remove a department, employee, or role. I also added the option to view employees by manager,  update an existing employee's role, view employees by department, and view the total utilized budget per department.
